            <p class="person-description">Agile is one of main development methods we are using in our projects. If you donâ€™t have precisely defined requirements on your application, you might need to create and test with users a prototype fairly quickly.  This is exactly the situation when agile is the right solution for you. We define iterations with you and actively participate on product development.</p>

            <p class="person-description">If your requirements are precisely defined, as well as you have defined a target group and application type, you can benefit from waterfall development method. We will create detailed analysis based on which we deliver complex solutions. This method is particularly useful for complex and enterprise mobile applications.</p>
